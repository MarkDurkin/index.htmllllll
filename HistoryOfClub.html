        <h2>Review of Manchester United 2008/09 Premier League win</h2>
        <p>

In this year's Barclays Premier League, Manchester United worked to repeat for their third year in a row as champions of this competition.
<p>
Starting off the year, United drew with Newcastle, scraped by with a 1-0 win against Portsmouth and lost to Liverpool, which caused very little anxiety for the fans.
<p>
But after a 1-1 against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the season started to turn around for Man Utd as they won five of their next six games, and were creeping around the top of the league table.
<p>
But after a loss at the Emirates Stadium to Arsenal, Edwin Van der Sar caught fire, as he didn't concede another goal for United for the next 1,311 minutes, setting a new single-season world record as he beat José María Buljubasich's record of 1,289 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal.
<p>
During Van de Sar's streak, United won 13 out of the 16 games played during this time, which propelled United to the top of the league table, and put them into position for another league crown.
<p>
However, United hit a major roadblock when they played Liverpool on March 14 at Old Trafford, as they lost 4-1, and started a downward spiral that also resulted in a loss to Fulham at Craven Cottage during their next game, which allowed Liverpool to gain even more ground on Man Utd.
<p>
Then, the night before their next game against Aston Villa at Old Trafford, Liverpool gained the lead in the league table.
<p>
Then during the game against Villa, and after Gabriel Agbonlahor scored for Villa at the beginning of the second half, the result of the game looked bleak for United as the score went to a 2-1 score. However, after a Ronaldo goal with about ten minutes left in the game, the game was tied at two.
<p>
But in the third minute of stoppage time, the entire fate of the league was changed as Federico Macheda, in his first ever game as a Red Devil, sunk a shot beyond Villa keeper Brad Friedel, giving United a 3-2 lead, and again held first place in the league.
<p>
After another Macheda miracle in the next game against Sunderland, United completely took over the league as they won five games and after a scoreless draw at Old Trafford against Arsenal, United won their third straight English Premier League and their 11th Premier League overall.</p>
